**Get Safety** is a full-stack web application designed for finding and managing shelters. Utilizing a mobile-first approach, it is optimized for ease of use on mobile devices. The app is built using React for the frontend, Express.js & Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Mapping**: Google Maps API
- **Authentication and Authorization**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Key Features
